We used Figma to gather resources and assets, to\n                                quickly build visualizations for ideas, and to prototype our design. We brainstormed, discussed, debated, and compromised as a team until we had design consensus. We\n                                    empathized with our users, and we approached every question and decision with the user in mind.</strong></p><br></br>\n                                <h6 className=\"mb-4\">WHAT I LEARNED:</h6>\n                                <p className=\"whatILearnedText\"><strong>The importance of user testing was again validated.
