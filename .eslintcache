We included a tab labeled “Sign up for Vaccine” that led directly to the county\n                        dropdown, which leads to the sign up form. We brainstormed ideas for the phases tab label, and eventually decided to test “Find Your Phase”.\n                        </p>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-md-center\">\n                    <Col className=\"col-12 col-md-4\">\n                        <div className=\"csPenPaperImages\">\n                            <img className=\"pencilAndPaper\" src=\"../../images/pencilAndPaper.jpg\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Pencil and paper journey map.\" />\n                        </div>\n                    </Col>\n                    <Col className=\"col-12 mt-2 pb-5\">\n                        <center><p><i>Pencil and paper journey map.</i></p></center>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-md-center\">\n                    <Col className=\"col-12 col-md-6\">\n                        <div className=\"csPenPaperImages\">\n                            <img className=\"countyJourney\" src=\"../../images/countyJourney.png\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Journey map from county page.\" />\n                        </div>\n                    </Col>\n                    <Col className=\"col-12 mt-2 pb-5\">\n                        <center><p><i>Journey map from county page.</i></p></center>\n                    </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-md-center\">\n                    <Col className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-2\">\n                        <p>We made a <strong>mock-up</strong> of the county page and added a large banner that clearly states who is currently eligible in that county by age and what phase the county is currently in.

We brainstormed, discussed, debated, and compromised as a team until we had design consensus.
